## Project Management

This project follows **Kanban Agile**, as required by FSI. Work is organized in **Businessmap (Kanbanize)** using milestones sized to ~20 hours each. Progress is reviewed through weekly team meetings and sponsor check-ins to ensure alignment and quick requirement clarification.

Tools used:

- **Businessmap** for Kanban workflow + milestone tracking
- **Git + GitHub** for version control
- **Discord** for communication and agendas

Kanban enables continuous development with flexible priority shifting — a better match for senior design work than sprint-based Scrum.

## Technology Stack

- **Game Engine:** Unreal Engine **5.1.1 → 5.2.1**
- **Development Language:** New work is written in **C++**  
  _(Previous DON groups relied heavily on Blueprints)_
- **Simulation Format:** Telemetry sourced from **MPC 2.0** simulations

This modernization effort focuses on improving performance, maintainability, and long-term extensibility of DON’s codebase.

## Collaboration Practices

- Weekly sponsor and internal meetings for updates and feedback
- Scope adjustments reflected directly on the Kanban board
- Milestones split as needed to keep tasks manageable
- Team members choose tasks aligned with their strengths and interest

Our objective is high communication, reduced blockers, and steady progress toward a polished demonstration of DON’s updated capabilities.
