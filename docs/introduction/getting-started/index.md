# Getting Started

This section provides instructions for setting up and running **Distributed Observer Network (DON)** on your local machine.  
While both Windows and macOS instructions are provided, **Windows is the recommended platform** for full functionality and performance.

## Windows Setup

This is the **preferred setup**.  
Follow the steps in [Windows Installation & Setup](don-setup.md) to install dependencies, configure Unreal Engine, and launch DON.  
All major features, including Cesium integration and telemetry parsing, are fully supported on Windows.

---

## Mac Setup

A limited setup option is available for macOS users.  
Refer to [Mac Installation & Setup](mac-don-setup.md) for configuration instructions.  
Note that some Cesium rendering and plugin features may not work as intended on macOS, and performance may vary.

> **Tip:** If you encounter build or runtime issues, verify your Unreal Engine version matches the one specified in the [Administrative](../administrative.md) section.
