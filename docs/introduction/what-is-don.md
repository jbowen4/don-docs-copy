## DON Overview

The Distributed Observer Network (DON) is a simulation viewer designed to make space mission data easier to share, visualize, and explore. Instead of exposing the proprietary internals of national or commercial simulation systems, DON works from exported telemetry and asset data — allowing simulations to be viewed interactively without violating ITAR or CUI restrictions.

With DON, users can:

- View spacecraft and celestial objects in real time using streamed telemetry
- Freely navigate the simulation using full camera control
- Record and replay simulations for analysis and review

By standardizing how mission results are shared and visualized, DON enables collaboration across agencies and countries while keeping sensitive technology secure — helping scientists and engineers collectively understand and plan humanity’s future in space.
