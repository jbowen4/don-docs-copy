## Background

The Distributed Observer Network (DON) began in 2005 as a NASA tool for preserving older simulations in support of the Constellation program. As the project evolved, its mission shifted from preservation to becoming a universal frontend capable of displaying space mission simulations without exposing proprietary technology. DON was later rebuilt as open-source in 2013, and has since become a key platform used in NASA educational events such as Virtual Mission 1, Simulation SmackDown, and the Simulation Exploration Experience (SEE).

Today, the University of Central Florida continues development and modernization of DON — improving rendering, performance, and usability to support future mission planning, including Artemis.

## Why DON Matters

Space missions rely heavily on simulation, but sharing simulation results across nations and organizations often encounters barriers: cost, licensing constraints, and security concerns. DON solves this by operating purely on telemetry outputs — allowing mission data to be shared openly without revealing sensitive internal systems or software.

DON enables:

- **Collaboration** across agencies and countries
- **Long-term preservation** of simulation data
- **Replay and analysis** without dependence on the original simulation tools

By decoupling data from proprietary formats, DON ensures mission knowledge can be retained, reused, and studied for decades — even as software evolves or becomes obsolete.

## DON in Education

DON is used globally as a hands-on learning platform. In annual events such as NASA’s **Simulation Exploration Experience**, university teams build distributed space simulations that are integrated and visualized through DON. Students gain real-world experience in modeling, simulation, and team collaboration — helping develop the next generation of aerospace and simulation professionals.
