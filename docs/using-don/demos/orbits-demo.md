Orbits Demo
Demo illustrates the Moon’s realistic orbital motion around the Earth
Accurately simulates tidal locking: same lunar face always points toward the planet.
The Earth simultaneously rotates on its axis, and the distance between the two bodies reflects their true 1:1 scale.
Demonstrates the ability to move and rotate planets across wide distances.
