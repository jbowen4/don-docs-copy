## Simulation Graphic User Interface

DON’s Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables users to interact with the chosen simulation and
customize what is displayed within the virtual environment. The primary elements of the DON GUI are
identified in Figure 3-1.

1. The telemetry control panel
2. The simulation menu
3. The metadata display windows

### Telemetry Control Panel

The telemetry control panel enables users to control simulation playback. By default this panel is
located in the bottom center of the screen.

Note: You can show/hide the mouse by pressing the Shift key, which will toggle/switch your cursor from controlling rotating your view around the environment and giving you access to your cursor to press buttons / click interact with some GUI elements (telemetry control panel, etc.).
