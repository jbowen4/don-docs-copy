## Simulation Selection

Selecting a simulation to view in DON consists of two steps – selecting the Mission and selecting the
telemetry. A Mission is the pairing of a specific set of models with the location in which their simulated
activities occur. Exchanging components or moving a set of models from the surface of one planet to
the surface of another constitutes a new Mission. Telemetry is the state information that identifies
model interactions at every given point in time for a specific scenario. Missions may have multiple
telemetries, each representing a different option for how the models could interact. For DON purposes
a simulation is defined by its telemetry; the two terms may be used interchangeably.
Example: Curiosity on Mars is a Mission. It identifies the models under assessment (the components of
the Curiosity rover) as well as the location where the simulation takes place (the surface of Mars). The
different traversal paths Curiosity can follow as it explores Mars are simulations. Each would be
represented in DON by a separate telemetry.

### 2.4.1 Choosing a Mission

Click on “Start Mission” on the DON Main Menu. This action will replace the main menu with a list of all
Missions available for viewing within the current DON installation. Clicking the “Back” button at the top
of the list will return the user to the Main Menu. Clicking any of the other items on the Mission list will
provide additional information about that particular Mission, including a picture and details about its
simulation content and origins.

### 2.4.2 Choosing Telemetry

There are two ways to get telemetry

1. Locally stored telemetry
2. Streamed telemetry
   - DON can use a real-time telemetry stream as the data source for any Mission available on the Mission
     menu

There is an option to used streamed telemetry but that reqiures access to the DON Federate.

#### 2.4.2 Choosing Telemetry (Locally stored telemetry)

After DON has finished loading all objects for the Mission, a dialog box will appear prompting the user to
select a simulation. Each item displayed in the box is a pre-generated telemetry file associated with the
chosen Mission.
