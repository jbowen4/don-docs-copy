Prior to our team, DON was only able to handle very small-scale simulations on a small piece of sculpted terrain. The goal of our team was to enable DON to handle simulations at space-scale distances while also maintaining the high level of detail (LOD) and precision needed.</p> <p>Space is big and to achieve our goal, we needed to implement a solution that overcame the limits of Unreal Engine's coordinate system and could handle / represent the insanely large distances of space. To accomplish this, we implemented a system described below which is defined by using two rendering modes: distant rendering mode &amp; close-range rendering mode.</p> <p>Our main goal was to maintain the perception of real space-scale interplanetary travel.</p> <p>More specifically, we needed to implement a scalable system to allow us to move these huge distances, and to make some demos demonstrate this.</p> <p>This involves not only representing planetary distances and sizes at 1:1 scale, but also allowing simulated objects to move between planetary objects (where a planetary object is a planet or large moon) freely and without disruption.</p>"},{"location":"design-docs/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>Block Diagram for DON v4.5</p> <p>This Block Diagram outlines the process that is followed to run a simulation in done, from reading in the telemetry data outlining the simulation's behavior to all the processes involved in rendering the sim correctly. This diagram shows essentially everything our group has done in DON.</p> <p>Here is the steps outlined again:</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, we create sample telemetry (using the MPC2 format) for our demo simulations. This is meant to    roughly mimic the behavior of the DON Federate Server, which streams telemetry data from real simulations,    since we are not able to access the Federate.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the telemetry data enters the DON application, it is converted to a format that we created that makes it    easy to work with, namely three core data structures that we created: ObjectInfo, ObjectInfoStore &amp; the Timeline. We    describe these more in detail here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, we use the player's camera position (the one object position not directly tracked by the ObjectInfoStore) to    figure out which rendering mode we need to be in. If there is a planet within a certain defined range of the    player's camera, then we switch to terrain rendering mode. If there are no nearby planets within range, we    use distant rendering mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, the next step depends on the rendering mode that we've been detected as being in:</p> </li> <li> <p>In terrain rendering mode, the closest planet becomes the center of the Unreal world (centered at origin). This planet is rendered at a high level of detail (LOD) using the Cesium plugin. The visibility and positioning of all other planets are handled by the Scale Manager &amp; they are visualized using billboarding if in view. The player's camera is used more \"normally\" in this mode, with its location being updated as the player moves around (free camera movement). The camera's location is relative to the center of the specified closest planet.</p> </li> <li> <p>In full distant rendering mode, the player's camera is locked at the origin of the Unreal world. The camera is the 'root.' The visibility, scaling, and positioning of all the planets in the simulation are controlled by the Scale Manager. Instead of using Cesium to render them at high detail, all planets are billboarded at the appropriate scale &amp; position as they would be given the player's position (which isn't actually updating the camera / moving but will give the illusion of movement by changing the planets' scale + position).

Ours is not that simple. The camera behaves differently depending on the rendering mode.</p> <p>In close rendering mode, the player behaves in a more normal way-- updating its position based on the player's keyboard input. However, in distant rendering mode, the player's camera is locked at the origin (0, 0, 0) of the Unreal world. The movement vectors associated with player keyboard input are not applied to the camera anymore. Instead, these vectors are used to move &amp; scale planets (using the Scale Manager) to give the illusion of movement.</p> <p>With the offset vector and the parent we can calculate the camera\u2019s position relative to any other object, which enables us to use it to move the player in terrain rendering mode, and move space around the origin locked player camera in distant rendering mode.

Floating origin is a technique used in 3D environments, especially games, to counteract floating-point precision errors that occur when objects are rendered far from the origin ((0,0,0)). It works by keeping the camera at the world origin and shifting all other game objects accordingly when the camera travels too far, preventing glitches like jittering and flickering.</p> <p>Shifting origin system</p>"},{"location":"design-docs/camera-rework/#close-range-rendering","title":"Close Range Rendering","text":"<p>In close rendering mode, the Cesium version of the planet is positioned at the center of the Unreal coordinate plane instead of the player camera.

This origin shifting is achieved using simple vector math.</p> <p>Motion in \u2018full\u2019 distant rendering mode is a bit of an illusion. The camera never actually moves from the origin. Instead, keyboard inputs lead to updates in the player\u2019s sun relative position. This is all handled by a subsystem known as the Solar Position Manager. This subsystem tracks and updates the positions of all objects, including the player camera, relative to the sun or the ultimate parent object. This task is executed every execution tick, and performs the acceleration and gradual deceleration math for the player camera in addition to calculating all other object positions. To calculate positions for standard objects, the system walks down the parent-child tree and adds up the position of each attached object to get an absolute position. These positions are stored in two different hash maps, each tying an object\u2019s name to a vector storing x/y/z position. This subsystem is actually always running, but only handles all player movement activities in full mode.

This strategy allows us to overcome Unreal\u2019s constraints on world size while still providing believable visuals over vast distances.</p> <p>On leaving the aforementioned distance threshold, the planetary object is unloaded as a Cesium asset and replaced with a billboard model in the distance.

We render an incredibly high-detail planet using Cesium, and things in the simulation are placed relative to that planet - which works well with how we\u2019re storing their positions in the first place. Also, in this mode, moving the camera actually moves the camera.</p> <p>When we pass a certain predefined distance (about 1 million kilometers) from the nearest planet, we switch to a different rendering mode: long-range rendering. Here, everything\u2019s placed relative to the viewer, and we use some neat tricks to make it look like you\u2019re moving across vast distances, without ever actually having a chance of leaving Unreal\u2019s coordinate system. Here, the camera is the origin and we don\u2019t actually move the camera at all! Instead of moving it, we just change the reference frame: scaling far off objects as though it were moving closer to them, and moving everything relative to the camera\u2019s \u201creal\u201d position.</p> <p>We use billboarding, a technique that plays with perspective to make things look like they\u2019re farther away from the viewer than they actually are. So for example, when we\u2019re on the surface of the Earth and we look at the Sun, instead of a gigantic ball of fire that\u2019s 93 million miles away, we have a teensy tiny ball of fire that\u2019s only 1 million miles away. How we actually find that position is a really clever bit of math, discussed in the Camera Rework section.</p> <p>To handle these two placement modes, we abstract it a bit: each mode has its own actor placement algorithm, or LocalPlacementManager. When we move to the new mode, the new algorithm takes care of placing each actor according to the new coordinate system we use for the given planet.</p> <p>Then we manage the actors themselves with the GlobalPlacementManager: this handles the transitions between levels, stores the actors, and gives the current object states to the current LPM so it can place the actors for the new simulation tick.</p> <p>Simply by changing the way objects are placed in the world, we can completely change the movement system behind the scenes, and the user is none the wiser.</p> <p>This architecture took a ton of work to implement, and required us to completely reimagine how objects should be placed in the world.

For example, if we're only billboarding planets and will never render them locally, the caller should put every planet in the LowResSpawners map only and everything else in the HighResSpawners map only.</p> <p>TODO figure out if there's even any cases where we'd have something visible in distant rendering that doesn't have its own level when it would be close, or even like a buggy that would be distantly-rendered or something... Oh ok we could always have a jupiter-sized duck that's both \"able to be distantly rendered\" and \"doesn't have its own map\" So, it would be better to just have the loader say whether or not a high-res or low-res object is needed.
